<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;"><strong>Get necessary information about each store</strong></span></h2>
  
Besides basic information such as name, address, and contact number, the shoppers will know about the opening hours and working days of the stores. Due to that, they might opt for the most convenient time to visit a store. Moreover, the websites or social channel links (such as <em>Facebook, Twitter, and Google Plus</em>) of the shops are probably displayed at the same time, where the customers can access to find more stores’ information.

<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;"><strong>Choose a preferable view</strong></span></h2>
  
There are two vision options in the <strong>Magento Store Locator</strong> map for the users to go for, which are <b>Map</b> and <b>Satellite</b>. More specifically, the Map contains all of the navigation, lightweight mapping power, and points of interest with just a small hint of satellite imagery, while the Satellite has complete 3D data and just a small subset of information on places, without any point-to-point navigation. In other words, the Map is for routing and getting to places while the Satellite is for exploring the size of buildings and the topography of the areas.

<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;"><strong>Set varied demonstrated images for stores</strong></span></h2>
  
Sometimes the stores can differ slightly or greatly in their main items/ decoration/ promotion and so on. Therefore, setting up different avatars represented for each shop might be a good idea, which would help the buyers enormously to choose which one they need or prefer.
  
<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;"><strong>Assign specific tags for each store</strong></span></h2>
  
As mentioned above, each of your stores can offer dissimilar types of products, or any of them are more major in some areas. Because of that, creating tags by giving each place some descriptive words is necessary to help customers distinguish and make easier searches.

<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;"><strong>Provide customers with vital stores information</strong></span></h2>
  
The store manager can add necessary information such as available product types, opening hours, working days, contacts, website, and address. In addition, it is recommended to offer promotions and discounts information to attract more visitors to the stores.
Furthermore, adding a store's social networks might be considered if you want to strengthen the interaction between the stores and the buyers.
